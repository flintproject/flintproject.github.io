* Introduction
  Flint is a simulator for biological and physiological models written in [[https://www.cellml.org/][CellML]], [[http://physiodesigner.org/phml/index.html][PHML]], and/or [[http://sbml.org/][SBML]].
  Originally developed as part of an in silico platform of [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physiome][Physiome]], now it aims to provide an open, language-agnostic resource for reproducible simulation studies.
  While existing simultion tools, e.g. [[http://copasi.org/][COPASI]] and [[https://opencor.ws/][OpenCOR]], are great for simulation of models in a specific language, you may find Flint useful if searching a unified solution.

  Flint has the following features:
  - It can numerically solve ordinary or stochastic differential equations derived from models.
  - It runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.
  - It provides fully-featured graphical user interface with simplified command-line interface.
  - It is open source under the MIT license.
